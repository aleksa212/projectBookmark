# projectBookmark
This project is created for practice purposes. This project allows the user to create, save and delete their own bookmarks.
Demo: https://project-bookmark-92bc8.web.app/

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use Web storage, specifically local storage. When the user saves a new bookmark, it is saved on their local storage.
The user can see all of their bookmarks, add new ones and delete existing ones. This was a great opportunity to practice dealing with events and changing the DOM dinamically.
This is where I first encountered and used Regex for valdating user input data.
